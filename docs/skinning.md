## Overview

TJAPlayer3 supports skinning of its user interface via image, audio, and configuration files.

Skinning is currently more limited and difficult than would be desired, but is flexible enough to approximate many console and arcade taiko rhythm game user interfaces.

Unfortunately, up-to-date documentation regarding all current skinning support does not exist at this time. In the document below you will instead only find information regarding skinning capabilities added and/or changed in TJAPlayer3 v5.2.0 or greater.

If you would like to help expand this documentation, please get in touch with the TJAPlayer3 contributors.

## Stages

### The Result Stage

#### Sounds

- `Sounds\Result BGM.ogg` is looped indefinitely while the Result stage is shown. (Required: TJAPlayer3 v5.2.0 or greater)
