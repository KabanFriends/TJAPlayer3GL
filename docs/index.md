## The Current State of TJAPlayer3 Documentation

TJAPlayer3 is currently lacking suitable documentation, as the source fork's documentation was maintained outside of version control and lost upon the abandonment of that project. The documentation will be recreated over time as additions and changes are made to the software.

## Skinning

TJAPlayer3 supports skinning of its user interface via image, audio, and configuration files.

Read more in [Skinning](skinning.md).

## Song Selection

### Song List Files

Required: TJAPlayer3 v4.7.0 or greater

You might want one song to appear in multiple locations within the song selection tree. You might want a set of songs to appear in a completely customized order. Instead of copying files and renaming them to control the order in which they appear, you can create and use Song List Files.

Read more in [Song List Files](song-list-files.md).

### Song Ratings / Favorites

Required: TJAPlayer3 v4.7.0 or greater

The song selection screen allows you to assign a rating to each song and to then sort / filter your view to more easily find and play songs of the ratings (or ranges of ratings) you want. You may also remove ratings from songs.
